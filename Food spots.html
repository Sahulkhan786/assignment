        <h1>Dakota Bar & Grill</h1>
         <p>This restaurant has really good reviews after looking on trip advisor i have seen this review
             "We visited Dakota Bar and Grill recently to celebrate the only we know how, as Dakota will
             never disappoint. And yet again they out done themselves. we had drinks at the bar, stunning
             vibes, festive cocktails and very attentive staff! At dinner as we were celebrating we were made
             to feel extra special and the food and drinks were incredible! the menu had so much to choose from
             with some very unique flavours and combinations as well as the classics to choose from!
             Couldn’t fault it and we can’t wait to return to Dakota for our next big celebration!!" this review has 
             boosted up this restaurant. The way the restaurant lures people into coming inside they use this as the main
             phrase at the strat of there website"Feel-good food with a fabulously fine twist. Simple, yet beautiful, dishes
             at our Manchester Grill restaurant showcase quality, seasonal produce at its best.
             Signature, prime cut steaks are our specialty. Grass-fed, 35-day-aged beef is lightly 
             seasoned then cooked to your liking over hot coals. Sourced from the very best British farms, 
             we present you with the best steak in Manchester".</p>

         <p>Before you ever visit this restaurant read these reviews"Nice little unit
             in the northern quarter serving hot dogs service was good and friendly it is 
             a good vibe food was nice enjoyed our visit here"If you are looking for a decent 
             hot dog or Philly cheesesteak in Manchester this is definitely a place you should go to.
             I have had cheesesteak in South Philly and this is every bit as good. Seems to be a lot of
             Americans searching out hot dogs at this venue which is also a good sign.
             Staff are very friendly and have great banter which makes this place perfect for
             the solo customer to eat at the bar. Highly recommended and can not wait to visit again!" </p>
