         <h1>Football</h1>
         <p>Manchester is renowned for its strong sporting culture, 
             with football being the most popular sport in the city. 
             The city boasts a rich footballing history, with both Manchester
             United and Manchester City being established in 1878. Manchester United, 
             originally known as Newton Heath FC, began as a football club for railway workers.
             The club participated in the FA Cup for the first time in 1886 and later changed its name 
             to Manchester United in 1902. Manchester City, on the other hand, started as a club sponsored
             by a church in 1878 and adopted the name Manchester City FC in 1894. The club achieved success 
             by winning the FA Cup in 1904. Although Bolton Wanderers FC is not located within the city limits,
             it is still considered part of the greater Manchester area. This historic club, founded in 1874,
             currently competes in League Two during the 2020/2021 football season, making it one of the oldest football
             clubs in England. Manchester has had the privilege of hosting numerous prestigious football events throughout
             its history. These include multiple FA Cup finals in 1893, 1911, 1915, and 1970, as well as the Football League 
             Cup Final in 1977, 1978, and 1984. The city also hosted the UEFA Cup Final in 2008, the UEFA Champions League Final
             in 2003, and the European Championship in 1996. Additionally, Manchester served as a venue for Olympic football games
             during the 2012 Olympics and played a significant role in the World Cup held in 1966.</p>

         <h1>Rugby</h1>
         <p>The Rugby club Broughton Rangers was established in 1877 and held their
             home games at Wheater's Field in the Broughton suburb of Salford.
             They were among the 21 clubs that formed the Northern Rugby Football Union
             in 1895 and emerged as champions in the inaugural season. Additionally,
             they secured victories in the Challenge Cup in 1902 and 1911. In 1913, Broughton
             relocated from their original ground to The Cliff, which later became the training 
             ground for Manchester United FC. They remained at this site for two decades before 
             moving to the Belle Vue Stadium in 1933, where they played within the speedway track. 
             This significant change in location meant that Broughton no longer represented their namesake area.
             However, it wasn't until 1946 that the team underwent a name change and began playing as Belle Vue Rangers.
             Despite efforts by a local businessman to revive the club in 2005, it ultimately ceased operations.</p>
