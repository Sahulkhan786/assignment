             ">Manchester Cathedral, known formally as the Cathedral and Collegiate 
             Church of St Mary, St Denys and St George, is located in Manchester,
             England. It serves as the main church for the Anglican Diocese of Manchester
             and is where the Bishop of Manchester presides. Situated on Victoria Street
             in the city center, the cathedral is a significant architectural landmark,
             being listed as a grade I building. Originally, the cathedral was a parish
             church that underwent reconstruction in the Perpendicular Gothic style after
             the establishment of the collegiate body in 1421. In the late 15th century,
             James Stanley II, who served as warden from 1485 to 1506 and later became the
             Bishop of Ely from 1506 to 1515, oversaw the rebuilding of the nave and collegiate
             choir. This included the addition of high clerestory windows and the commissioning
             of exquisite late-medieval wooden internal furnishings, such as the pulpitum, choir
             stalls, and the nave roof adorned with gilded instruments. In 1847, the collegiate
             church was designated as the cathedral for the newly formed Diocese of Manchester. 
             Over the years, the cathedral has undergone significant renovations, expansions, and
             restoration projects. During the Victorian era, it was extensively refaced, restored,
             and extended. Additionally, the cathedral had to be repaired following bomb damage 
             sustained during World War II. Today, it stands as one of Manchester's fifteen Grade
             I listed buildings, showcasing its historical and architectural significance.</p>
        
         <h2>Old Trafford</h2>

            ">Old Trafford, located in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England,
             serves as the home stadium for Manchester United. It is renowned as the
             largest club football stadium in the United Kingdom, with a capacity of 
             74,310. In fact, it is the second-largest football stadium overall in the 
             country, only surpassed by Wembley Stadium. On a European scale, it ranks
             as the twelfth-largest stadium. Situated approximately 0.5 miles (800 meters)
             away from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram stop, it enjoys a
             convenient location. Given the nickname "The Theatre of Dreams" by Bobby Charlton,
             Old Trafford has been Manchester United's cherished home ground since 1910. However,
             during the period of 1941 to 1949, the club had to share Maine Road with their local 
             rivals, Manchester City, due to bomb damage caused by the Second World War. Over the
             years, Old Trafford has undergone various expansions, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s.
             These expansions included the addition of extra tiers to the North, West, and East Stands,
             nearly restoring the stadium's original capacity of 80,000. Looking ahead, there are plans 
             for future expansion, which may involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, 
             potentially increasing the capacity to around 88,000.</p>

            ">Manchester Town Hall, also known as Manchester City Council Hall or 
             simply Manchester Town Hall, is a Victorian Neo-Gothic town hall built

             on the north side of Albert Square and on the south side of St Peters Square,
             facing the southern entrance of the building. The building contains offices,
             grand ceremonial rooms, including the Great Hall, which is adorned with the most
             impressive Manchester Murals ever painted depicting the history of Manchester.
             The entrance to the hall is lined with busts and sculptures of some of the citys
             most influential figures, including Dalton (1st Baroness Dalton), Joule (2nd Baroness Joule)
             and Barbiroli (3rd Baroness Barbiroli). The buildings clock tower rises to 280ft (85m)
             and houses the clock bell Great Abel. Two covered bridges connect the building to Lloyd 
             Street, which was completed in 1938. On 25 February 1952, the building was designated 
             Grade I listed.</p>
