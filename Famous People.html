        <h1>Emmeline Pankhurst</h1>
         <p1 style="font-size: 55px;"> She became involved in women's suffrage in 1880 and formed the
             Women's Social & Political Union (WSPU) when her local branch of the 
             Independent Labour Party refused to admit women members.
         
         In 1879 Emmeline Goulden married Richard Marsden Pankhurst, lawyer, friend
         of John Stuart Mill, and author of the first woman suffrage bill in Great
         Britain (late 1860s) and of the Married Women Property acts (1870, 1882). 
         Ten years later she founded the Women Franchise League, which secured (1894) 
         for married women the right to vote in elections to local offices (not to the House 
         of Commons). From 1895 she held a succession of municipal offices in Manchester, but 
         her energies were increasingly in demand by the Women Social and Political Union (WSPU),
         which she founded in 1903 in Manchester. The union first attracted wide attention on October 
         13, 1905, when two of its members, Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney, thrown out of a Liberal
         Party meeting for demanding a statement about votes for women, were arrested in the street for a 
          technical assault on the police and, after refusing to pay fines, were sent to prison.</p1>
